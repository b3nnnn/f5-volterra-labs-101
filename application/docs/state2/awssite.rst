AWS Site
========

Previously for the "on-prem" site you needed to manually provision and configure 
a node for use with VoltConsole.  Deploying a site in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform
uses a process that automates the steps of deploying the site.  This enables VoltConsole
to perform the deployment on behalf of the end-user (you can also use Terraform to deploy a 
site, but that will be covered in a separate lab).
