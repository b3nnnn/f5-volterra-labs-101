Multi-cloud Application Services
=================================

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

DemoBrews is a company that specializing specialty craft beers. 
The company has a fledgling e-commerce business to go along with their existing stores.  
The customer's dev team has built and maintains a web application.
The app is deployed in an expensive on-premise data center (ie. the UDF deployment).
Due to ongoing operational expenses the company would like to move the application "to the cloud".

The customer has multiple architectural goals:

- Due to privacy concerns, the database must remain on-prem.
- Due the agile nature of the app, the architecture design must allow for new services to be easily added and independently scaled.
- The dev team would prefer to not be locked into a single cloud service provider (CSP).

Over the course of this lab, we will help the customer meet these design goals with the Volterra platform.
