Multi-cloud Application Services
=================================

Day 0
~~~~~~

A customer has recently started an e-commerce business to go along with their existing store.  
The customer's development team has built a client/web application ("Demo Brews") and it's currently 
deployed in an on-premise data center (ie. the UDF deployment). Due to operational expenses and expected growth the dev team
is planning on moving the application into AWS.

The customer has multiple architectural goals:

- Due to privacy concerns, the database must remain on-prem.
- Due the agile nature of the app, the architecture design must allow for new services to be easily added and independently scaled.
- The customer is comfortable with AWS at this time, but would prefer to not be locked into a single cloud service provider (CSP).

Over the course of this lab, you will help the customer meet these design goals by using the Volterra platform.
