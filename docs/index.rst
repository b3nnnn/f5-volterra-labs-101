This Lab environment highlights some of the basic concepts of VoltMesh.

During the lab you will be emulating a customer that needs to extend an
existing on-premises internal application to a Public Cloud environment.
The goal is to securely extend the application into the cloud environment
and have it highly availabe in both on-prem/cloud simultaneously.

Lab Environment

The on-premises environment is emulated by using a UDF environment that contains NGINX
resources.

The cloud environment is emulated by using a UDF Cloud Account in AWS that contains
