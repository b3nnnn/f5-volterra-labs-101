Lab 2: Configure Site Networking
================================

During this lab you will use VoltConsole to

- Create a fleet
- Create a Network Connector

During the previous lab you created a site.  This creates an initial network
endpoint for VoltMesh, but it does not provide any information about how to
connect into or out of the site network.

This next lab will configure the site to allow it to connect to remote resources
outside of the site as well as allow remote resources to connect into the site.
